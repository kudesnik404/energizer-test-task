Test task (simple web-page)

Different font so the end result is not pixel perfect.

I changed "old prices" because otherwise the maths didn't add up.

Wanring:
"Choose your plan" select should be completely rewritten (without using <select>) but there's not enough time :/ ... sorry
The page is not responsive. At all. Same reason.
Autorenewal checkboxes are awesome but broken.
Whats up with second question's height?
Fonts are a mess though I stylized them the same as in Figma. Everything sould be good if changed to Kaspersky sans (line 8).
FAQ answers lack soft animation.
Footer jumps.
There are a lot of small mistakes that need to be fixed. Not enough time...





Nobody is perfect.
