# kaspersky-energizer
Test task (simple web-page)

Why is it in English? ...i dunno 

Wanring:
Different font so the end result is not pixel perfect.
I changed "old prices" because otherwise the maths didn't add up.
Whats up with second question's height?
FAQ answers lack soft animation.



Nobody is perfect.



Btw, unlike any other pages I saw on one of the pages (https://partnersearch.kaspersky.com/?b2b&locale=en) the Kaspersky logo is not clickable therefore you can't go to the main page through the current "Find a Partner". I know... not my business, but it's just an observation which I'm sharing because there might be a mistake... Wonderful website though!
