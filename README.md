Test task (simple web-page)


Different font so the end result is not pixel perfect.
I changed "old prices" because otherwise the maths didn't add up.
Whats up with second question's height?
FAQ answers lack soft animation.
FAQ answers go beyond footer.
Regret doing the task vanilla, should've chosen React. Especially because of the slider which I haven't done. No slider dots.
Cards don't snap.
Diffrent card's height in mobil version.
faq and footer are not adapted for mobile

The Webpage is not 100% complete!
