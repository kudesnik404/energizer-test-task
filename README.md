# kaspersky-energizer
Test task (simple web-page)

Why is it in English? ...i dunno 

Wanring:
Different font so the end result is not pixel perfect.
I changed "old prices" because otherwise the maths didn't add up.
"Choose your plan" select should be completely rewritten (without using <select>) but there's not enough time :/ ... sorry
The page is not responsive. At all. Same reason.
Autorenewal checkboxes are awesome but broken.
Whats up with second question's height?
Fonts are a mess though I stylized them the same as in Figma. Everything sould be good if changed to Kaspersky sans (line 8).
FAQ answers lack soft animation.
Footer jumps.
There are a lot of small mistakes that need to be fixed. Not enough time...



Nobody is perfect.



Btw, unlike any other pages I saw on one of the pages (https://partnersearch.kaspersky.com/?b2b&locale=en) the Kaspersky logo is not clickable therefore you can't go to the main page through the current "Find a Partner". I know... not my business, but it's just an observation which I'm sharing because there might be a mistake... Wonderful website though!
